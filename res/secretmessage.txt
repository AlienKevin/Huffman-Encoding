Hi, Avery. Thank you so much for this amazing quarter! I thoroughly enjoyed
your sections and they are a big help for understanding and expanding things
covered in the lecture. I also like how you listen to people's questions attentively
and give back useful and clear answers. Hope you have an amazing rest of the summer!

Your student,
Kevin Li
